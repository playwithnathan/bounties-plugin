# bounties-plugin
A Minecraft Spigot plugin for bounties.

Comprised of two main features:
- Player to player bounties
- Server to player bounties

If you don't want to participate in bounties, you don't have to!
However, if you would like to participate in bounties, the first thing you must do is give your consent.
`/bounties consent`

At anytime you can use /bounties help to be presented with the following information:
- `/bounties list` Displays all the current bounties.
- `/bounties set <player>` <amount> Set a bounty on a player.

Server bounties are assigned hourly.
Who gets picked and the amount of money are both partially dependent on the player's score.
Your score is based upon your playtime and player kills.
The higher your score is, the more likely you are to get assigned a server bounty.
